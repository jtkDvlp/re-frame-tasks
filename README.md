# Tasks interceptor / helpers for re-frame

Interceptor and helpers to register and unregister (background-)tasks (FXs) in your app-state / app-db to list tasks and / or block single ui parts or the whole ui.

## Features

* register / unregister tasks / fxs via one line interceptor injection
  * support multiple and any fx on-completion keys via registration
* subscriptions for tasks list and running task boolean
  * running task boolean can be quick filtered by task name
* events to register / unregister tasks yourself
* helpers to register / unregister tasks into db yourself

Also works for async coeffect injections, see https://github.com/jtkDvlp/re-frame-async-coeffects.

## Getting started

### Get it / add dependency

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj`:<br>

### Usage

See api docs [![cljdoc badge](https://cljdoc.org/badge/jtk-dvlp/re-frame-tasks)](https://cljdoc.org/d/jtk-dvlp/re-frame-tasks/CURRENT)

```clojure
(ns jtk-dvlp.your-project
  (:require
   [re-frame.core :as rf]
   [jtk-dvlp.re-frame.tasks :as tasks]))


(rf/reg-event-fx :some-event
  ;; give it a name and the fxs to monitor
  [(tasks/as-task :some-task [:some-fx [:fx 1]])
   ;; supports async coeffects
   (acoeffects/inject-acofx :some-acofx)]
  (fn [_ _]
    (println "handler")
    {;; modify your task via fx
     ::tasks/task
     {:this-is-some-task :data}

     :some-fx
     {:on-success [:some-event-success]
      :on-error [:some-event-error]
      :on-complete [:some-event-completed]
      ,,,}

     :some-other-fx
     {:on-done [:some-other-event-completed]
      ,,,}

     :fx
     [[:some-fx
       {:on-success [:some-event-success]
        :on-error [:some-event-error]
        :on-complete [:some-event-completed]
        ,,,}]

      ;; monitored fx referenzed via path [:fx 1]
      [:some-other-fx
       {:on-done [:some-other-event-completed]}]]}))

(defn app-view
  []
  (let [block-ui?
        (rf/subscribe [:jtk-dvlp.re-frame.tasks/running?])

        tasks
        (rf/subscribe [:jtk-dvlp.re-frame.tasks/tasks])]

    (fn []
      [:p "open developer tools console for more infos."]

      [:<>
       [:button {:on-click #(rf/dispatch [:some-event])}
        "exec some event"]
       [:button {:on-click #(rf/dispatch [:some-bad-event])}
        "exec some bad event"]
       [:button {:on-click #(rf/dispatch [:some-other-bad-event])}
        "exec some other bad event"]

       [:ul "task list " (count @tasks)
        ;; task is a map of `::tasks/id`, `:name`, `:event and the
        ;; data you carry via `::task` fx from within the event
        (for [{:keys [::tasks/id] :as task} @tasks]
          ^{:key id}
          [:li [:pre (with-out-str (cljs.pprint/pprint task))]])]

       (when @block-ui?
         [:div "this div blocks the UI if there are running tasks"])])))
```
